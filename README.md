# routingSimEngine
This is a project implementing sort of an engine to simulate game theoretical routing agents in a network.


This project was started with not much planning or forethought, hence it was quite the challenge to get everything working in the end.
We ended up making our own implementation for the simulation and further defining our own simulation configuration / simulation output files (everything from/to json).

To give a visual representation, we use the library streamgraph to create the graph representation and java swing for the rest around it.

Started/created by Oberd√∂rfer Tobias, Oswald Lorena, Pobitzer Markus, Suter Antoine for GameTheory Course may 2020 at ETHZ.
